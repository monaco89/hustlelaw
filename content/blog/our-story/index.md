As someone who considers himself a scrappy entrepreneur at heart and in practice, Hustle's Founding Partner, Daniel Marcus bootstrapped his first company while pursuing his JD as a full-time law student, leading a double life, learning about the nuances of Antitrust and Intellectual Property by day and building a first of its kind tech platform (and subsequently pounding the pavement to make people aware of said tech platform - see photographic evidence to the left) by night. As such, he knows what it means to hustle. Though he went to law school to become a more versatile and "dangerous" entrepreneur, he realized that his experience on both sides of the table could make him a valuable asset/advocate for similarly minded folks - and thus Hustle Law was born.
