        We are a firm that practices what it preaches, founded by an
        entrepreneur and startup Founder who bootstrapped his first company
        through law school and then decided it was a good idea to start a couple
        more right after. We advise and provide counsel to entrepreneurs, tech
        companies (both big and small), artists/content creators, athletes, and
        anyone in between on matters that range from business formation,
        contract drafting, review, and negotiation, intellectual property
        matters, corporate governance, etc.{" "}
